# This travis config:
#   Invokes contain_build.sh to build npad-support using a docker build
#   container.
#   Handles gcloud credentials.
#   On successful build (on pushes only) deploys rpm to
#   legacy-rpms-mlab-xxx.
#     * On all builds from other repos, pushes rpm to
#       legacy-rpms-mlab-sandbox, to owner/repo/branch folder.
#     * On untagged builds from m-lab repo dev branch, pushes rpm
#       legacy-rpms-mlab-staging, to testing folder.
#     * On tagged builds from m-lab repo, pushes rpm to
#       legacy-rpms-mlab-staging, to canary folder.
