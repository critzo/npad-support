# This travis config:
#   Invokes contain_build.sh to build npad-support using a docker build container.
#   Handles gcloud credentials.
#   On successful build (on pushes only) deploys rpm to legacy-rpms-mlab-sandbox.
#     * On tagged build from m-lab repo, pushes rpm to 'staging' folder.
#     * On untagged builds from m-lab repo master branch, pushes rpm to 'master' folder.
#     * On all builds from other repos, pushes rpm to 'private' folder.
